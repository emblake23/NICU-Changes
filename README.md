# NICU-Changes

The Rmd file (final_nicumaps.Rmd) can be used to create US maps show in the changes in number of NICUs by county from 1996-2011, 2011-2023, and 1996-2023, using the three individual NICU directory files (cleannicXX.csv)

Additionally, the shapefile used for Hawaii is included in zipped format, as the HI in the tigris file did not contain the correct classification/grouping of islands based our needs

Finally the three final map products are included
